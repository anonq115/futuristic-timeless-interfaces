In many cases, we don't have much of a choice. Recently I applied for Paid Family Leave through my state's website. They'll mail you a form, but the form says they prefer that you file online. The website has a phone number. If you call the number and you're lucky enough to get through, it tells you to use the website. (Most of the time, it says "too many callers" and hangs up.) There is no physical office to which I can go to talk to a real human.
The website itself isn't too bad, I guess. You fill out the form, which is easy enough, and hit submit. At the top there's an "Inbox" section with zero messages.

Two weeks later, you get a letter in the mail. Snail mail, not email. And it says your claim has been approved/denied. Nothing in the website inbox.

As far as I can tell, the inbox does nothing. All communication from the state to you goes through snail mail.

It's wild and crazy and is giving me the biggest headache ever. But I have no other choice, so I put up with it. What else am I to do?
